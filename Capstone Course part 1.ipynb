This project is timely as the city is currently suffering from oversupply of Bakery. Data from the National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) released last year showed that an additional 15 per cent will be added to existing Bakery space, and the agency predicted that total occupancy may dip below 86 per cent. Thelocal newspaper The Dubai Mail also reported in March last year that the true occupancy rates in malls may be as low as 40 per cent in some areas, quoting a Financial Times (FT) article cataloguing the country continued obsession with building more shopping space despite chronic oversupply. </p>"

We will use web scraping techniques to extract the data from the Wikipedia page, with the help of Python requests and beautifulsoup packages. Then we will get the geographical coordinates of the neighbourhoods using Python Geocoder package which will give us the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighbourhoods.After that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods. Foursquare has one of the largest database of 105+ million places and is used by over 125,000 developers.Foursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, we are particularly interested in the Shopping Mall category in order to help us to solve the business problem put forward. This is a project that will make use of many data science skills, from web scraping (Wikipedia), working with API (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering) and map visualization (Folium). In the next section, we will present the Methodology section where we will discuss the steps taken in this project, the data analysis that we did and the machine learningtechnique that was used. </p>"
